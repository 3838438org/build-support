The software contained in this package are licensed under multiple licenses.  It is not feasible to include all of the licenses here in a precise manner.  For clarification on licensing issues, please contact the OS X X11 Users mailing list (http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/MailingLists).  What comes below is an attempt to give a brief overview of some of the relevant licenses.

libXplugin is not open source.  It is licensed to you under the same conditions as any Apple Software Update (although lacking any warranty, since this is *NOT* an official Apple release).

All other software installed is made available under an OSI approved license (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) including, but not necessarily limited to the following licenses: MIT, BSD, APSL-2, GPL-2, and LGPL-2.

Unfortunately not all of the included software are released under the same license, so a comprehensive license is not available here.  For questions regarding the license of an individual component, please check the license in the module or file's header, or direct questions to our mailing lists (see http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/MailingLists).
