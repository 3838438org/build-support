The software contained in this package are licensed under multiple licenses, and it is not feasible to include all of them here in a precise manner.  For clarification on licensing issues, please contact the Mac OS-X X11 Users mailing list (http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/MailingLists).  What comes below is an attempt to give a brief overview of some of the relevant licenses.

All software installed into /usr/X11 is made available under an OSI approved license (see http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical) including, but not necessarily limited to, the MIT license, GPL, LGPL, and APSL.

Software installed by this package outside of /usr/X11 (quartz-wm and libXplugin) are not open-sourced and are licensed to you under the same conditions as any Apple Software Update (although lacking any warranty, since this is *NOT* an official Apple release).

Unfortunately not all software is released under the same license, so a comprehensive license is not available at this time.  For questions regarding the license of an individual component, please check the license in the file's header or direct questions to our mailing lists (see http://trac.macosforge.org/projects/xquartz/wiki/MailingLists).
